HandWave-Sample-Apps
====================
> A collection of Android apps using the HandWave library.


## Overview 
HandWave is a library that allows developers to enable touch-free interactions in their apps. 
HandWave uses the built-in, forward-facing camera on a device to recognize users’ in-air gestures. The API provides developers with easy access to a variety of touch-free gestures which invoke callback functions when detected. 

These apps show different ways in which the library can be used (including the code to do so!).

Code for HandWave can be found [here] (https://github.com/kritts/HandWave).

## Example apps


* **25 Gestures** 
	* This is a game with 25 rounds. In each, the player is prompted to make a gesture in a specific direction (either up, down, left, right, or "click") in front of the camera. The player automatically moves onto the next round when the camera detects an accurate gesture.
	* [The apk can be downloaded here.] (https://github.com/kritts/HandWave-Sample-Apps/blob/master/25Gestures/bin/PracticeGestures.apk)
* **Gallery** 
	* This is a simple app that allows a user to view images in a gallery. The user can scroll left or right (to the next or previous image) by making a left or right gesture in front of the camera.
	* [The apk can be downloaded here.] (https://github.com/kritts/HandWave-Sample-Apps/blob/master/Gallery/bin/HandsFreeGallery.apk)
* **Text Reader** 
	* This is a hands-free text reader. The user can scroll through up or down through the text by moving their hand up or down in front of the camera.
	* [The apk can be downloaded here.] (https://github.com/kritts/HandWave-Sample-Apps/blob/master/TextReader/bin/GestureScrollerTest.apk)
	
	
Note: I've created a few more apps using the HandWave library and plan to upload them soon.
